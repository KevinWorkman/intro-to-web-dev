# Week 2: CSS

Modify `index.html` and `styles.css` to show some styled text.

Where the text comes from is up to you. Here are some ideas:

- Your favorite poem
- A recipe you recently tried
- Song lyrics
- An excerpt from a book
- A scene from the script of a movie or TV show

Add your text to the `<body>` of the `index.html` file. You can include any HTML
tags you want. For example you might use `<div>` tags to separate your text into
sections, and you might give each `<div>` a different CSS class or ID.

Then modify `styles.css` to style your text.

Your `styles.css` file should contain at least the following:

- 3 element selectors, e.g. change the body element's background color
- 2 ID selectors, e.g. change the font of the top heading on your page
- 5 class selectors, e.g. make every noun on the page bold
