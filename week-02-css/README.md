# Week 2: CSS

Modify `index.html` and `styles.css` to show some styled text.

Where the text comes from is up to you. Here are some ideas:

- Your favorite poem
- A recipe you recently tried
- Song lyrics
- An excerpt from a book
- A scene from the script of a movie or TV show

Add your text to the `<body>` of the `index.html` file. You can include any HTML
tags you want. For example you might use `<div>` tags to separate your text into
sections, and you might give each `<div>` a different CSS class or ID.

Then modify `styles.css` to style your text.

Your `styles.css` file should contain at least the following:

Your `styles.css` file should contain at least the following:

- An element selector, e.g. change the body element's background color or set

- An ID selector, e.g. change the font of the top heading on your page
- A class selector, e.g. make every noun on the page bold
- One instance of cascading multiple styles together, e.g. one element has two classes
- One instance of overriding a style with a more specific one, e.g. an element has a class and an ID that both define a background color
