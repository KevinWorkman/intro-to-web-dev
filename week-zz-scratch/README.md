# Scratch

This files in this directory are not tied to any particular week or project. You
can edit these files whenever you want. Use this to test out small code
snippets, to try out new syntax, or for any other reason.

You can also create new directories and files for any reason. I'll only look at
the "official" weekly project directories, unless you ask me to look somewhere
else for debugging purposes.

Using a temporary "scratch" space is a common technique while coding. If you
want to try something out but don't want to break anything in your projects, you
can do that here!
