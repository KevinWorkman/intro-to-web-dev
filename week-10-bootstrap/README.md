# Week 10: Bootstrap

This week, you're revisiting and "Bootstrapifying" your project from week 3.

During week 3, you created a website for a business, and you wrote the HTML and
CSS yourself. This week, you're making a website for that same business, but
you're using Bootstrap instead.

You can copy the files from week 3 into this directory, or you can start from
scratch if that's easier.

When you're done, your website should contain at least the following:

- 1 Bootstrap container
- 1 Bootstrap row with at least 2 columns
- 3 Bootstrap components

Optional bonus challenge: if you finish all of the above and want some more
practice, try adding Bootstrap to previous projects, or look for other UI
frameworks and try them out.
